# MemeCMS
A CMS like system which allows you to post text articles. Made in under 3 hours with PHP and MySQL. <br>
Technically should be secure, but I have not personally checked it out. It was made by a friend. <br><br>
Does not have a user registration form or an installer. <br> You need to edit the db.php and settings.php files and import the database.sql file to phpmyadmin or heidisql etc. Then you are good to go. <br><br>
Default admin credentials are: admin:1234
